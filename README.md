# blackbox-rs

blackbox-rs is a series of Rust crates that is to be paired with [BlackBox](https://github.com/BlackboxMC/Blackbox), which allows you to create Bukkit compatible plugins using compiled langauges such as Rust.

# Versioning

Four of the crates are frozen at `0.4.0` due to no longer needing updates. The only one that gets updates is `blackboxmc-rs-bukkit`, which uses semantic versioning but places the patch version at the equivalant Minecraft version. For example, `1.2.21` is version 1.2 of the plugin, with compatibility for 1.21.

# Contributing

Due to the massive scale of Spigot's API, BlackBox is automatically generated by the `generate.py` script. There is a system for hand written code to be added via the `additions` folder. I am adverse to using macros or anything that would have the code generated at compile time, because I am a believer that if you are debugging a library, you should be able to go to the repo and have a good idea of what the code is doing.

A `spigot.json` file is required; it is not in the repo, you have to generate it via [this repo](https://github.com/BlackBoxMC/SpigotJSON).
