**The repo currently contains breaking changes due to some bugs in the Python script + changes in the script that generates the .json file. The end result will be a version 2.0 which WILL contain breaking changes, just not intentionally.**

# blackbox-rs

blackbox-rs is a Rust crate that is to be paired with [BlackBox](https://github.com/BlackboxMC/Blackbox), which allows you to create Bukkit compatible plugins using compiled langauges such as Rust.

# Contributing

Due to the massive scale of Spigot's API, BlackBox is automatically generated by the `generate.py` script. There is a system for hand written code to be added via the `additions` folder. The file references a file that isn't referenced in the repo; you have to generate it via [this repo](https://github.com/BlackBoxMC/SpigotJSON) and then move the resulting .json file into this one, where it is gitignored. This is because the file as of writing this is extremely large and would make the repo even slower to clone if I included in.
